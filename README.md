# Week-7---Networking
Networking Using Java Sockets

Run the file from any IDE or terminal java <Filename>.

To see if the server is up and running, I have designated the port 12345 for the exercise and enter in terminal - localhost nc 127.0.0.1 12345

The Server is exited by entering the terminator text - "week" in this case.
